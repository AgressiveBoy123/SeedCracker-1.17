## !! WARNING !! ##

**You don't need to download this mod anymore since KaptainWutax has already released another Seed Cracker for the 1.17 update. This is pretty much useless now (maybe I'll update the mod in future versions of minecraft). Sure, If you still want to download it there's nothing stopping you, but I highly recommend just going over to KaptainWutax's github page and downloading it from there.**
